# Fullstack task

You are provided with a working application consisting of a backend server and a client-side React table.
The backend server exposes a single API endpoint `/automations` to fetch all automations data from a JSON file.
The client currently fetches all data at once and displays it in a table with a scroll.

## What to do:

1. **Backend Pagination**: Load and display data in pages instead of fetching all items at once.
2. **Backend Sorting**: Allow the user to sort table columns by making backend requests.
3. **Backend Filtering**: Add the ability to filter data (all columns except id) by using query parameters in the API.
4. Add filters components that will allow you to choose the value from a dropdown menu (if you have many options in the drop down what will you do?). The filter should support only "is" operation, i.e if the user choose name = 'avi' you should bring all entities with this type.
5. Add pagination component in the UI.
6. When refreshing the page, the current filters and sorting should be kept.

## Bonus:
- Implement the "items per page" functionality - Dropdown in the UI and support on the server

## Clarifications

1. You can use MUI library and any other library as you like.
2. You can use chatGPT.
3. Due to the fact we don't have a real DB here, its ok to do "query" on the json (make it object and get whatever data you need with javascript) even though it's not efficient.
4. Don't spend time on design and fancy css but it should be reasonable UX.

## Getting Started

To start the application, please follow these steps:

### BE

1. Navigate to server folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start the backend server.

### FE

1. Navigate to client folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend.

### Example
