# nocode-pagination
=======
# Fullstack task

You are provided with a working application consisting of a backend server and a client-side React table.
The backend server exposes a single API endpoint `/automations` to fetch all automations data from a JSON file.
The client currently fetches all data at once and displays it in a table with a scroll.

## What to do:

1. **Backend Pagination**: Load and display data in pages instead of fetching all items at once.
2. **Backend Sorting**: Allow the user to sort table columns by making backend requests.
3. **Backend Filtering**: Add the ability to filter data (e.g., by status or type) using query parameters in the API.
4. Add filters components that will allow you to choose the value from a dropdown menu (if you have many options in the drop down what will you do?)
5. Add pagination component in the UI.

## Bonus:

- Add sorting in the UI.
- Implement the "items per page" functionality - Dropdown in the UI and support on the server

## Clarifications

1. You can use MUI library and any other library as you like.
2. You can use chatGPT.
3. Due to the fact we don't have a real DB here, its ok to do "query" on the json (make it object and get whatever data you need with javascript) even though it's not efficient.

## Getting Started

To start the application, please follow these steps:

### BE

1. Navigate to server folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start the backend server.

### FE

1. Navigate to client folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend.

### Example

You can see a working example with different data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16733CJ6TFLz36x2wx2jzR-pWnlKHFBE3/view?usp=sharing).

Feel free to ask any questions ;]
Enjoy!
